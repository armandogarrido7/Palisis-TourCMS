Hello, my name is Armando Garrido Rodriguez, and this is my project for the technical test for Palisis / TourCMS

To install dependencies, you need to install composer if you don't have it installed, run 
```
composer install
```
and execute
```
php index.php
```
or run index.php on a web server that has PHP installed, such as Apache or Nginx.
This way you will be able to see the result on a web browser.

Thank you very much for your time! :)
